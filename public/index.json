[{"content":"Building a Zoning Chatbot with GeoPandas, Folium, and the OpenAI API I wanted to create a proof-of-concept chatbot that could answer basic zoning questions using spatial data. The idea was simple: enter an address, and get back a zoning summary with a map. I used a combination of Python tools I already lean on—GeoPandas, Folium, and the OpenAI API—and wired them up into a notebook that does just that.\n🧠 The chatbot takes in an address, geocodes it with Nominatim, runs a spatial join with a zoning shapefile (in this case, for Marin County), and then sends the resulting zoning description to the OpenAI API for summarization. It returns both the original zoning text and a cleaned-up explanation in plain English. I also generate an interactive map with Folium showing the parcel boundary and surrounding zoning.\nOne of my main goals here was accessibility—I wanted a zoning lookup tool that produces output that\u0026rsquo;s easy to read aloud by a screen reader or text-to-speech tool. A lot of existing GIS interfaces aren\u0026rsquo;t optimized for accessibility or non-technical users. This approach keeps the logic spatial but outputs something lightweight, plain-text, and structured for assistive tech.\n🗺️ Try it yourself You can view the interactive version here:\n🔗 View the interactive version\n🔧 Tech Stack GeoPandas for spatial joins Folium for web map generation geopy + Nominatim for geocoding openai Python library for GPT-based summarization A zoning geojson of Unincorporated Marin County from Open Data 📂 Files \u0026amp; Structure This notebook defines four core functions:\nlookup_zoning(address): Geocodes the input address, converts it to a GeoDataFrame, reprojects to match the zoning data, and performs a spatial join to find the intersecting zoning polygon. summarize_zoning(zone_gdf): Extracts zoning attributes from the joined polygon, builds a prompt, and sends it to the OpenAI API for summarization. show_result_map(point_geom, result_gdf): Uses Folium to visualize the point and intersecting zoning polygon. zoning_chatbot(address): High-level wrapper function that ties everything together, prints the zoning attributes, gets the summary, and shows the map.

Map Initialization: Uses a MapView with a default zoom centered on Marin County. A custom extent is defined for a consistent viewport. Search Integration: The Esri Search widget enables address and Parcel ID lookups, which trigger FeatureLayer intersections. Layer Queries: Parcel, zoning, and general plan layers are all hosted in ArcGIS Online and queried dynamically using spatial intersects relationships. Intersection Logic: A unified query checks all layers and extracts the smallest relevant feature to reduce ambiguity. UI Rendering: Results are displayed in a sidebar panel. The view automatically zooms to the selected parcel or clicked feature. Performance Optimization: Layers are hidden by default and only displayed at appropriate zoom levels based on view.scale watchers. 📦 Tech Stack ArcGIS API for JavaScript (CDN) Static HTML/CSS/JS, deployed on GitHub Pages Hosted ArcGIS Online feature layers Fully client-side, no server-side code 🖼️ Architecture Diagram 🔗 Open in a new tab for full responsiveness\nSource code available on GitHub.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e🛠️ \u003cstrong\u003eZoning Lookup Tool — Technical Breakdown\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis application is a browser-based GIS tool built using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript (v4.27), designed to help users search and interactively query zoning information for Marin County, CA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"-features-and-architecture\"\u003e🔧 Features and Architecture\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFramework\u003c/strong\u003e: The app is written in plain JavaScript and styled with custom CSS and the ArcGIS dark theme.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMap Initialization\u003c/strong\u003e: Uses a \u003ccode\u003eMapView\u003c/code\u003e with a default zoom centered on Marin County.
