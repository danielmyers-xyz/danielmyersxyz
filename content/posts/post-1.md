🛠️ **Zoning Lookup Tool — Technical Breakdown**

This application is a browser-based GIS tool built using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript (v4.27), designed to help users search and interactively query zoning information for Marin County, CA.

### 🔧 Features and Architecture

- **Framework**: The app is written in plain JavaScript and styled with custom CSS and the ArcGIS dark theme.
- **Map Initialization**: Uses a `MapView` with a default zoom centered on Marin County. A custom extent is defined for a consistent viewport.
- **Search Integration**: The Esri `Search` widget enables address and Parcel ID lookups, which trigger `FeatureLayer` intersections.
- **Layer Queries**: Parcel, zoning, and general plan layers are all hosted in ArcGIS Online and queried dynamically using spatial `intersects` relationships.
- **Intersection Logic**: A unified query checks all layers and extracts the smallest relevant feature to reduce ambiguity.
- **UI Rendering**: Results are displayed in a sidebar panel. The view automatically zooms to the selected parcel or clicked feature.
- **Performance Optimization**: Layers are hidden by default and only displayed at appropriate zoom levels based on `view.scale` watchers.

### 📦 Tech Stack

- ArcGIS API for JavaScript (CDN)
- Static HTML/CSS/JS, deployed on GitHub Pages
